# Dashboard Experiment Brief

## Why `Dashboard` is the first target

`Dashboard` is the best first comparison surface for this repository because it is a better test of React 19 and RSC value than a client-heavy editing page.

It has three useful properties:

- one clean Inertia entrypoint
- one large React page component
- a presenter-driven data shape that is already a natural candidate for server/client decomposition

That makes it easier to ask whether React on Rails Pro plus React 19 can improve composition, streaming, payload boundaries, or maintainability without claiming that the whole app should move off Inertia.

## Current architecture

### Rails controller

- Route: `/dashboard`
- Controller: [app/controllers/dashboard_controller.rb](../app/controllers/dashboard_controller.rb)
- Rendering path: `render inertia: "Dashboard/Index", props: { creator_home: presenter.creator_home_props }`

### Presenter

- Presenter: [app/presenters/creator_home_presenter.rb](../app/presenters/creator_home_presenter.rb)
- Main responsibility: build the `creator_home` payload for the page

The presenter currently assembles:

- getting started checklist state
- best-selling products data
- balance summaries
- activity feed items
- tax form/download state
- stripe verification message

### Inertia page wrapper

- Entry: [app/javascript/pages/Dashboard/Index.tsx](../app/javascript/pages/Dashboard/Index.tsx)

This wrapper is intentionally thin. It simply reads `creator_home` from Inertia props and passes it into the page component.

### Main React page

- Component: [app/javascript/components/DashboardPage.tsx](../app/javascript/components/DashboardPage.tsx)

The page currently renders:

- page header
- tax form and verification alerts
- getting started checklist
- empty-state greeter
- best-selling products table
- four stats cards
- activity feed

## Why this is promising for an RSC comparison

The current implementation already has a strong server/data boundary:

- Rails presenter builds a large page payload
- Inertia sends the payload once
- React renders a mostly read-heavy page around that payload

That means the likely React 19/RSC comparison seam is not "replace everything." The seam is:

- keep some interactive client pieces as client components
- move read-heavy or data-assembly-heavy sections toward server-rendered React boundaries
- compare whether that split is clearer or lighter than the current presenter-plus-Inertia-props model

This is also why the current `Rspack` branch should not be treated as the runtime test.

- `Rspack` is the tooling and developer-experience upgrade.
- `RSC` is the page-runtime hypothesis.
- The route metrics we just captured are the baseline that the `RSC` branch must beat.

## Most likely comparison seams

### High-confidence seams

- best-selling products table
- activity feed
- tax forms/download section
- getting started checklist shell

### Lower-confidence seams

- stats cards

These are already simple and may not benefit enough to matter.

## Proposed first RSC cut

Keep the first demo narrow and bias toward read-heavy sections:

- render the overall dashboard route through React on Rails Pro
- keep the page shell and any dismiss/minimize interactions as client components
- move the best-selling products table into a server component
- move the activity feed into a server component
- test whether the tax-form and verification sections are better as server-rendered React fragments rather than Inertia payload

The core comparison should be:

- current Inertia page ships one large `creator_home` prop into the client
- RSC version keeps more of that assembly and rendering on the server and ships only the client code that still needs to be interactive

## Current behavior worth preserving

- sellers with no activity still get a useful dashboard state
- suspended sellers are redirected away from the page
- the getting started checklist has dismiss/minimize state
- existing controller and presenter specs already cover important state transitions

## Current test surface

Relevant existing files:

- [spec/controllers/dashboard_controller_spec.rb](../spec/controllers/dashboard_controller_spec.rb)
- [spec/presenters/creator_home_presenter_spec.rb](../spec/presenters/creator_home_presenter_spec.rb)

This is useful because the experiment can preserve and extend a bounded spec surface instead of inventing new coverage from scratch.

## Baseline capture checklist

Before changing implementation, capture:

- screenshot of dashboard with no activity
- screenshot of dashboard with meaningful activity
- `data-page` payload size for the `creator_home` prop
- loaded JS and CSS assets for the dashboard route
- basic notes on navigation/load behavior
- notes on how much logic currently lives in the presenter vs React

## Environment status for baseline work

Current verified state:

- Docker-backed local services boot
- Rails boots locally on `:3000`
- the Shakapacker dev server boots locally on `:3035`
- nginx boots locally once `helperai.dev` cert files exist
- the current dashboard spec surface is green locally after test merchant-account seeds are loaded

That means the next engineering step is no longer setup. The next engineering step is baseline capture plus the first upgrade branch.

## Hidden prerequisites discovered during setup

- The dashboard spec surface depends on seeded `MerchantAccount` records in `RAILS_ENV=test`.
- `db:prepare` alone did not create those rows in test on this machine.
- Loading these seed files fixed the issue:
  - `db/seeds/010_stripe_merchant_account_seeds.rb`
  - `db/seeds/020_braintree_merchant_account_seeds.rb`
  - `db/seeds/030_paypal_merchant_account_seeds.rb`
- The local nginx proxy also expects `helperai.dev` certificates, not just the checked-in `gumroad.dev` certificates.
- The repository already provides `bin/generate_ssl_certificates` for this, but CA installation may still require a manual sudo step on macOS if browser trust matters.

## First implementation slice

The first real code branch should be:

- upgrade React to 19
- upgrade Shakapacker to `10.0.0`
- switch the current Inertia app from Webpack to Rspack

This should happen before adding the separate React on Rails Pro surface, because it answers an important positioning question directly:

- can Shakapacker plus Rspack improve this app today without asking Gumroad to leave Inertia?

If that branch stays low-risk, it becomes a much easier review story than opening with a React on Rails migration pitch.

## Current branch result

That first branch is now partially proven locally:

- `shakapacker` is upgraded to `10.0.0`
- React and React DOM are upgraded to `19.2.5`
- the app builds successfully with Rspack in both development and production
- the Rspack dev server boots successfully
- the dashboard controller and presenter spec slice still passes

The branch also surfaced two concrete adoption costs:

- the repo's old `react-dom@18.3.1` patch is obsolete and had to be removed because React 19 already includes `inert`
- `npx tsc --noEmit` now reports broad React 19 type fallout across the app

That means the positioning story is already stronger:

- Rspack migration looks technically viable for Gumroad's current Inertia app
- React 19 support is not a free upgrade here and may need its own cleanup branch before it is easy to upstream

This is useful evidence, not a setback, because it tells us where the real review cost sits.

## Measured dashboard baseline

The first route-level comparison is now captured in [performance-findings.md](./performance-findings.md).

The explicit success bar for the next branch is documented in [rsc-benchmark-plan.md](./rsc-benchmark-plan.md).

What matters:

- developer build time improved substantially under Rspack
- the bundler branch did not produce a route-level win, which is expected
- dashboard JS transfer grew materially under the current branch

That changes the standard for the next demo:

- it is not enough to show that React on Rails Pro or RSC is possible
- it has to beat the current Inertia baseline on page-level metrics that justify extra complexity

For this target, the most important metrics to beat are:

- dashboard JS transferred
- dashboard LCP
- total dashboard navigation duration

The right reading of the current numbers is:

- they establish the baseline for the `RSC` branch
- they do not tell us whether `RSC` can win yet

## Success condition for this target

The `Dashboard` experiment is a success only if it can show a narrow, credible win such as:

- clearer section boundaries between server-rendered and client-rendered concerns
- smaller or more deferrable client payload for the page
- better perceived loading behavior
- a meaningfully better development model for evolving the page

For positioning purposes, the strongest version of that success is:

- materially less dashboard JS
- equal or better LCP
- no meaningful regression in total navigation duration

If it cannot do that, the right conclusion is that `Dashboard` should stay on the current Inertia shape and the positioning lesson should be captured honestly.
