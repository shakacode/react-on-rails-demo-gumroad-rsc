# Current Status

## Short answer

The demo pair is implemented, measurable, and now useful for positioning.

It is **not** ready for an upstream pitch yet, but it is no longer just a compile-and-run experiment.

This repository has moved past pure planning, through the Rspack migration branch, and into a matched Inertia-versus-React on Rails Pro comparison surface.

## What is already done

- Created the public experiment repo under `shakacode/react-on-rails-demo-gumroad-rsc`
- Seeded it from current `antiwork/gumroad`
- Preserved `upstream` so the experiment stays grounded in the real app
- Documented the comparison plan in [rsc-comparison-plan.md](./rsc-comparison-plan.md)
- Documented the runtime pass/fail rubric in [rsc-benchmark-plan.md](./rsc-benchmark-plan.md)
- Documented positioning, adjacent ideas, and IP guardrails in [positioning-notes.md](./positioning-notes.md)
- Added a single performance handoff doc for review circulation in [performance-team-handoff.md](./performance-team-handoff.md)
- Selected `Dashboard` as the first comparison surface
- Documented the first implementation-facing brief in [dashboard-experiment-brief.md](./dashboard-experiment-brief.md)
- Documented measured results in [performance-findings.md](./performance-findings.md)
- Added a browser-level smoke spec that renders both `/dashboard/inertia_demo` and `/dashboard/rsc_demo` through a real headless browser in CI
- Added route-scoped `Server-Timing` instrumentation to both comparison routes and to the benchmark output
- Added an alternating benchmark runner in `scripts/perf/compare_dashboard_routes.rb` so route order is balanced across cycles
- Added benchmark runner support for `--require-driver-match` and `--reuse-existing` so headline runs fail fast on browser-driver mismatch and long runs can be recovered without remeasuring completed samples
- Added median and `p95` primary-metric deltas plus slowest-pack-resource summaries to the alternating comparison output so dev-asset outliers are obvious without manual per-run digging
- Installed Ruby gems locally
- Installed `node_modules` locally
- Brought up the Docker-backed local services
- Confirmed the targeted dashboard controller and presenter spec surface passes locally once required seed data exists
- Upgraded `shakapacker` to `10.0.0`
- Upgraded React and React DOM to `19.2.5`
- Switched the local Shakapacker bundler path from Webpack to Rspack
- Added a real `config/rspack/` config tree instead of relying on the deprecated webpack-config fallback
- Confirmed `bin/shakapacker` builds successfully in both development and production with Rspack
- Confirmed `bin/shakapacker-dev-server` boots successfully on `https://gumroad.dev:3035/`
- Removed an obsolete `patch-package` patch for `react-dom@18.3.1` because React 19 already includes the needed `inert` support
- Added React on Rails Pro and the Node renderer configuration locally
- Added a dedicated `/dashboard/rsc_demo` route backed by the existing `CreatorHomePresenter`
- Added a matching `/dashboard/inertia_demo` route using the same reduced seller-data surface
- Built a bounded React on Rails Pro plus RSC dashboard surface that reuses real seller data
- Built a matched Inertia control surface that shares the same reduced UI intent
- Isolated the RSC route from the main Inertia `base` pack so the comparison surface is actually separate
- Kept the demo-only JS and CSS route-scoped so non-demo pages do not download the comparison assets
- Wired React on Rails nonce handling into Gumroad's `SecureHeaders` setup so streamed inline RSC payload scripts are allowed under CSP
- Regenerated `js-routes` so the comparison routes are available to both the Inertia and RSC demo code
- Added explicit development host allowlisting for the local Gumroad domains so the benchmark/login flow works again on `gumroad.dev:3000`
- Captured successful browser measurements for the matched Inertia and RSC demo routes
- Manually verified both demo routes in a signed-in browser session and captured comparison screenshots in `docs/images/`
- Fixed the standalone RSC demo test-build path so `RAILS_ENV=test` writes the client manifest and browser bundle to `public/packs-test`, which made browser-level CI validation of the RSC route possible
- Reduced the raw RSC comparison response from about `36.9KB` to about `15.1KB` by trimming server markup, compacting demo props, and rebuilding the dedicated RSC bundles
- Re-ran `spec/presenters/product_presenter/product_props_spec.rb` after seeding merchant accounts in test: `26 examples, 0 failures`
- Re-ran `spec/presenters/creator_home_presenter_spec.rb`: `22 examples, 0 failures`

## What is not done yet

- the React 19 type fallout has not been cleaned up yet across the app
- the broad React 19 cleanup still needs its own reviewable branch strategy
- the full current `/dashboard` route is still too noisy for a fair RSC-versus-Inertia story
- production-like benchmarking is still missing, and the latest local measurements are sensitive to cache order
- the demo has not yet been reduced to a compelling upstream-review story

## What "demo ready" means

The demo should not be considered upstream-ready until it can show all of the following:

- one clearly chosen page or flow
- a matched Inertia implementation running as the control
- a bounded React on Rails Pro implementation of the same surface
- enough React 19 or RSC usage to make the comparison meaningful
- disciplined measurements for loading behavior and developer tradeoffs
- a short written conclusion that says where Inertia wins and where React on Rails Pro wins

## Measured findings

The matched comparison measurements now exist, and the latest local pass now includes route-scoped `Server-Timing`.

Short version:

- Rspack is a strong developer-performance win here
- no route-level runtime win was expected from the bundler swap by itself
- the stricter alternating local benchmark still has the `RSC` route ahead on total navigation duration and `LCP`
- that stricter method keeps `responseEnd` and route-level `action_total` modestly in the Inertia control's favor
- route order and warm-state effects are real enough that the alternating runner is now the benchmark method that matters

That means the demo is now real, the user-visible story is still favorable, and the current tradeoff is cleaner to explain.

The missing piece is no longer "can this compile?" The missing piece is "does the favorable local result survive production-like measurement discipline and renderer profiling?"

The benchmark rubric for that decision now lives in [rsc-benchmark-plan.md](./rsc-benchmark-plan.md).

## Environment readiness

Current local state:

- Docker is available
- Docker-backed services are running
- `node_modules` is installed
- gems are installed
- Rails boots locally on port `3000`
- the Rspack-backed Shakapacker dev server boots locally on port `3035`
- `bin/dev` now boots the standalone React on Rails Pro Node Renderer on port `3800`
- local nginx now boots once `helperai.dev` cert files exist

That means the repository is now ready for comparison work on this machine.

## Setup findings that matter

- `RAILS_ENV=test bin/rails db:prepare` was not enough for the dashboard spec surface because the test database had no `MerchantAccount` rows.
- Loading the three merchant-account seed files in `RAILS_ENV=test` fixed that hidden prerequisite and made the targeted dashboard suite pass.
- `make local` initially left nginx down because `docker/local-nginx/helperai_dev.crt` and `.key` were missing.
- The repository already includes `bin/generate_ssl_certificates` for this, but on macOS it may fail at `mkcert -install` if local sudo access is not available.
- For local-only boot, generating the `helperai.dev` cert files without installing the CA is sufficient to get nginx running, though browsers may still warn about trust.
- A later repeat with matching `Chrome 147` and `ChromeDriver 147` removed the earlier browser-driver mismatch, but one RSC dev-asset load still reported a `~19.3s` zero-transfer CSS duration, which is another reason the next pass needs production-like assets.

## Verified implementation state

- Development build: `RAILS_ENV=development NODE_ENV=development bin/shakapacker --mode development`
  Result: successful Rspack build for both the main app bundles and widget bundles
- Production build: `RAILS_ENV=production NODE_ENV=production bin/shakapacker`
  Result: successful Rspack build with asset-size warnings but no compilation failures
- Dev server: `RAILS_ENV=development NODE_ENV=development bin/shakapacker-dev-server`
  Result: boots successfully on `https://gumroad.dev:3035/`
- Standalone RSC build: `npm run build:rsc-demo`
  Result: successful React on Rails Pro bundle build

## Current blocker for calling the branch "review ready"

The build path is working and the matched comparison surface is running, but two blockers remain before this is review ready as a persuasive stacked branch:

- React 19 adoption still exposes broad TypeScript cleanup work across the app.
- The strictest local result is still a development-mode measurement, and the matched-driver repeat exposed a dev-asset timing outlier while renderer-internal profiling is still missing.

Current `npx tsc --noEmit` results still show app-wide errors in categories like:

- stricter React 19 `ref` typing
- callback refs that return values instead of `void`
- implicit `any` in callbacks that previously slipped through
- at least one `isolatedModules`-related type-only import fix

That means the branch has crossed the important threshold of "Rspack migration is viable here" and "a matched React on Rails Pro comparison is feasible here", but it has not yet crossed the threshold of "this is an easy upstream review with a repeatable, production-like runtime-performance story."

## Latest balanced alternating local comparison result

The strictest current local comparison uses `scripts/perf/compare_dashboard_routes.rb`, which rotates route order by cycle instead of relying on separate grouped batches.

Short version:

- the `RSC` demo works end to end under React on Rails Pro
- the `Inertia` control works end to end on the same reduced data surface
- the `RSC` route now renders through the same `inertia` outer layout as the control so the comparison is cleaner
- the response-end pass shrank the raw RSC response to nearly match the Inertia control on transfer size
- earlier grouped batches overstated the RSC advantage because route order mattered
- under the balanced alternating method, the `RSC` route is still faster on total navigation duration and `LCP`
- under that same method, the Inertia control remains modestly faster on `responseEnd` and route-level `action_total`
- the position split shows the Inertia control is more sensitive to route order than the RSC route, which is useful context but not a reason to ignore the stricter aggregate result

Useful numbers:

- alternating Inertia navigation duration: `568.47ms`
- alternating RSC navigation duration: `501.53ms`
- alternating Inertia LCP: `602.00ms`
- alternating RSC LCP: `525.00ms`
- alternating Inertia response end: `423.23ms`
- alternating RSC response end: `441.65ms`
- alternating Inertia `action_total`: `250.50ms`
- alternating RSC `action_total`: `278.32ms`
- alternating Inertia `compare_props`: `226.41ms`
- alternating RSC `compare_props`: `236.16ms`
- alternating Inertia HTML transfer: `14,240.5` bytes
- alternating RSC HTML transfer: `15,265.0` bytes

So the current conclusion is:

- the comparison surface is real
- the user-visible win is now real on the matched surface
- the current stricter method still shows a real server-side tradeoff
- measurement order clearly matters, and the alternating runner now gives us a more defensible local result
- a later matched-driver repeat kept favorable medians for RSC, but it also exposed one dev-asset outlier that makes a production-like rerun the next real checkpoint
- the performance pitch is promising, but not yet ready for upstream review

## Recommended next step

The next real step is to keep the claims and branches narrow.

Recommended order:

1. Preserve this branch as the "Shakapacker 10 plus Rspack viability" branch.
2. Decide whether React 19 type cleanup belongs in the same branch or in a follow-up stacked branch.
3. Treat `/dashboard/inertia_demo` as the primary Inertia control, not the full dashboard.
4. Keep `/dashboard/rsc_demo`, but use the alternating runner and route-scoped `Server-Timing` together when making any performance claim.
5. Keep CI honest with the GitHub-hosted demo validation workflow for this public repo: it validates the Rspack build, the targeted demo controller specs, and the standalone `npm run build:rsc-demo` path.
   It now also boots the Node renderer and runs a headless browser smoke spec for both demo routes.
6. Re-run the alternating comparison with `--require-driver-match` and a production-like renderer and asset setup.
7. Only then decide whether a deeper migration story is warranted.

## Suggested branch sequence

- `jg-codex/baseline-dashboard`
- `jg-codex/react19-rspack`
- `jg-codex/react19-type-cleanup` if the type fallout is too noisy for the bundler branch
- `jg-codex/react-on-rails-pro-demo`
- `jg-codex/demo-server-timing`
- `jg-codex/benchmark-headline-metrics`

## Adjacent ideas to keep documented but out of scope for the first demo

- a clean-room Inertia extension that improves React 19 SSR behavior
- a React 19 compatibility guide for Inertia users
- a Shakapacker plus Rspack positioning story that works for both Inertia and React on Rails users

## Decision rule

If the matched React on Rails Pro plus RSC comparison cannot keep the user-visible win while making the server-response tradeoff understandable, then the right output is better positioning insight, not a migration pitch.
